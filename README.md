# Mean-field interacting multi-type birth-death model

- The notebook [`mean-field-interacting-MTBD.ipynb`](mean-field-interacting-MTBD.ipynb)
demonstrates how to compute self-consistent fields for a multi-type birth-death process with mean-field interactions mediated by moments of the process.
- The environment file [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) contains the list of packages required to run the notebook.
- The output directory contains plots produced by the notebook.
